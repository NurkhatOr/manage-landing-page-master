My second FrontEndMentor project

Hello Friends

This is my second challenge.

Here I used SCSS for the first time.

I ran into a problem after uploading files to the github repository. The problem is the background image in hero section is not displayed after publishing the site. But it is visible when I run html file using VS Code. Can anyone tell me what an issue is?

Also I have problems with the look of carousel in desctop view. I couldn't understand why it looks as it is now. I am new for JS and I watched Kevin Powell videos to make the Carousel.

I would be very thankful for your reviews and suggestions.
